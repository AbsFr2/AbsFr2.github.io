            <h2>Problem Statement: Freshman's Problem </h2>
            <p>Students all over the country are entering college without getting the opportunity to have an
                in-person orientation, and are expected to be able to navigate the campus on their own with no
                prior knowledge of the campus layout. New college students need an easier way to be able to
                find where their classes are at, and how to get to them without being late to class
